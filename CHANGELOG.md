# Changelog

All notable changes to Frothy are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are the `vX.Y.Z` git
tags described in the "Releasing" section of CONTRIBUTING.md.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect has a packaged UF2.** `frothy flash`
  builds or writes the board directly, release bundles validate and carry its
  UF2, and the browser flasher downloads that same artifact for the native
  `RPI-RP2` drag-and-drop flow.
- **The Nano's NINA-W102 provides Wi-Fi and BLE.** Its board profile now
  implements the existing Wi-Fi, HTTP, TCP, BLE observer, and BLE broadcaster
  words with pinned WiFiNINA/ArduinoBLE libraries. BLE requires NINA firmware
  3.0.0 or newer. A radio-free RP2040 build remains available for boards
  without NINA hardware.

### Changed

- **Every echoed diagnostic source line now carries a `source: ` prefix.**
  It used to appear only when the echoed line began with `> ` or `! `, to
  stop source text from imitating a prompt. Making it unconditional removes
  that special case and leaves the body with exactly one unlabelled line —
  the human message — so a host identifies each line by its own prefix
  instead of counting from the caret. The caret is aligned to the prefixed
  line, and stays best-effort: when the response buffer fills, the device
  keeps the `source: ` line and drops the caret. Hosts must accept a body
  with no caret.

### Fixed

- **Two expressions on one line no longer ask for a bracket.** Inside a
  block, `1 2` reported `expected ']' to close the block` with the caret on
  the `2` — the caret was right, but the sentence sent the reader looking
  for a missing bracket. It now reads `one expression ends here -- start the
  next on a new line or after ';'`, which is the rule the block actually
  enforces. A block that really is unclosed, and one closed with the wrong
  bracket, keep the message they had.

- **A definition whose left side is not a name now says why.** `3 is 4`
  answered a bare `error: invalid (8)` with no message, no source line, and
  no caret, because the parser used a silent return to tell the reader
  "this is not a definition, try an expression". It now records `expected a
  word name` on that path; the fallback to the expression parser clears it,
  so an ordinary expression is unaffected.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- **`save`, `restore`, and `dangerous.wipe` are prompt words now.** Called
  from inside a word, an event body, or `boot`, they answer
  `error: prompt only (26)` and stop that form instead of running. They
  replace the image the running program is executing from: on ESP32 the
  old mapping is unmapped the moment the new one takes over, so the next
  instruction the caller read was a fault; on the host the instructions
  survived but the frame's own bytes, objects, and names did not. The
  guide already gave this rule ("Do not hide this cycle inside one word")
  — the runtime now keeps it.

  This replaces a published contract: a nested `save:` used to raise
  `not saved (13)` when a slot held a volatile value, and to *succeed*
  otherwise. It now always refuses, with a reason that is true either way,
  and stays catchable by `attempt`/`rescue`. The prompt is unchanged —
  bare `save`/`save:` and the REPL commands behave exactly as before.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-07-26

### Changed

- **`save` no longer refuses because hardware is open.** Typing `save`
  with `led is pwm.open: ...` in your program used to answer
  `notice: not saved (13)` and persist nothing, so the way to save your
  code was to close the resource, rebind the slot, save, and reopen. Now
  the prompt's `save` writes those slots as `nil`, keeps the handles
  running — the LED stays lit, the program keeps its bindings — and says
  what it did:

  ```text
  > save
  notice: saved; handle values stored as nil (100)
  detail: 'led' was stored as nil - recreate it in boot so a reboot brings it back
  ok
  ```

  A reboot restores those slots as `nil`, which is what they could ever
  have been; `boot` is where reopening belongs. Code 100 is the first
  notice code that reports a success — codes below 100 remain `fr_err`
  values. Unchanged: `save:` inside any larger form still raises the
  catchable `13` and aborts that form, and the prompt still refuses
  outright for a live Bluetooth connection, a library-mode slot, or more
  handle-bound slots than the device can hold at once.

### Fixed

- **Giving a live handle a second name works.** `led2 is led` used to
  answer `error: not saved (13)` and bind nothing, which was doubly
  confusing: nothing was being saved. The definition path folds a name
  into a literal so the overlay image can carry it, and an image cannot
  carry a handle. A handle is no longer treated as a literal, so the
  binding reads the slot when the line runs — the two names then refer to
  the same open resource, and closing through one invalidates the other.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Errors can now say why.** Rejections that used to stop at
  `detail: adc.read argument 1 was rejected` carry a one-line reason:
  `-- pin has no analog input (ADC1)`. The first set covers the walls
  students actually hit — non-analog pins on `adc.read`/`adc.above?`,
  `busy` on `pwm.open` frequency changes, `gpio.write`/`gpio.mode` on a
  PWM-held pin, reopening an open uart port, and `watchdog.feed` before
  `watchdog.arm`. Notes are static text on the existing detail line; the
  wire protocol and error codes are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Failed opens no longer spend handle identities.** Opening a busy
  resource (a uart port already open, a pin held at another frequency)
  used to consume a handle-table generation per attempt; enough retries
  — a `forever` loop polling an open, for instance — permanently retired
  the table until reboot. A reservation released before its open
  succeeds now rolls its generation back, which is safe because the
  handle value never reached user code.
- **A failed platform close no longer strands the resource.** Bulk handle
  cleanup (`wipe-user`, `restore`, project clear) used to clear the
  runtime entry even when the platform kept the slot — the pin then
  reported `busy` until reset with nothing left to close. The entry is
  now preserved so the next cleanup retries the close, an exact-repeat
  `pwm.open` still reaches the live channel, and `ble.off` (whose radio
  teardown frees connections wholesale) forgets its entries afterwards
  instead of leaving stale ones.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **`wipe-user` and `restore` close platform handles.** Both replace the
  user tier, dropping every binding that could close an open handle while
  the platform channel stayed open — so an editor wipe-then-rerun cycle
  found the pin `busy` and only a reset could recover it. Handles are user
  runtime state, like events, and both paths now close them.

### Added

- **The firmware reports its release.** `status` gains a `release=` field on
  every target, and the new `frothy.release` word (text-enabled profiles,
  which includes every shipped board) returns the release name as text. The
  value is one compile-time constant the build stamps from the git tag via
  `tools/release-name.sh` — the same owner feeds the firmware, the ESP-IDF
  build, and the flasher bundle manifest, and a release-named stamp file
  makes cached builds rebuild when it changes. Boards flashed before this
  release cannot say what they run; everything after can.

### Changed

- **`pwm.open` on a held pin: an exact repeat succeeds, everything else is
  `busy`.** Re-running the same open — same pin, same frequency — returns
  the existing handle with no state change, so re-evaluating a setup line
  at the prompt just works. A different frequency on a held pin reports
  `busy` (previously an undifferentiated `bad value`); changing
  configuration remains an explicit `pwm.close` + `pwm.open`.
- **`gpio.write` and `gpio.mode` refuse a PWM-held pin with `busy`.**
  Driving a pin as plain GPIO silently detached it from the PWM peripheral
  while the channel kept running; the conflict is now a diagnosable error.
  `gpio.read` still works on any pin.
- **`frothy source-plan` accepts `--entry <path>`** (default `main.fr`) so
  the editor can run any project file as the include-resolution root. Entry
  paths obey the same confinement rules as include targets.

### Removed

- **Duration suffixes on integer literals** (`2s`, `500ms`, `400us`, `400ns`),
  introduced alongside digit grouping and shipped in 0.1.10. The suffix was a
  compile-time multiply with no duration type behind it, so it looked checked
  but was not: `wait: 50ns` meant 50 milliseconds, and `2s` in a
  nanosecond-unit call meant 2 microseconds. A unit now lives where it always
  did — in the word's contract and, when a word has a non-default unit, in its
  name (`pulse.duration-ns`, `trace.delta-ns`). A digit-led token with a
  trailing suffix falls back to being a name, like any other non-integer
  token. Underscore digit grouping (`1_000_000`) is unchanged.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **Ctrl-C reaches a running program even behind buffered input.** The
  safe-point interrupt poll re-examined one saved typeahead byte forever, so
  any character that arrived before a Ctrl-C — a host request written to a
  busy board, a typed-ahead key — made the interrupt unreachable until reset,
  including against a saved boot routine stuck in `forever`. The poll now
  drains the console driver directly; measured interrupt latency behind
  buffered input is ~50 ms on hardware.
- **Input typed ahead of `console.read-line` survives the poll.** Drained
  non-interrupt bytes are kept in a small typeahead ring and handed to the
  next console read in order; a Ctrl-C discards input queued behind it. VM
  throughput is unchanged (spin benchmark at parity on `esp32_devkit_v1`).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Wi-Fi can be composed out of a build.** `net` joins `ble` as an offered
  capability: a composition that turns it off drops the radio stack (~600 KB
  of flash on a classic ESP32). Libraries can declare hardware needs with
  `requires = ["i2s"]`.
- **Builds report their measured size.** Every ESP-IDF build writes
  `build/<board>/size.json`: the app image against the flashed partition
  table's app partition, plus IRAM/DRAM (and shared-pool DIRAM) usage.
  Reporting never fails a build that otherwise succeeded.

### Changed

- **The app partition is 2 MiB on every board.** All boards share one
  partition table sized to real hardware (4 MB flash floor; larger chips
  keep their profiles). An all-features image now keeps roughly a third of
  the partition free instead of 7%.
- **Error 8 is named `invalid`, not `bad source`.** The code is shared by
  the parser and by library precondition failures, and the old phrase lied
  outside the parse path. Parse failures keep their specific diagnostics
  (message and caret), so nothing is lost where the old name was right.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Console programs can read one human-entered line.** `console.read-line:`
  waits for a complete data line without turning it into Frothy source, while
  Ctrl-C still interrupts the active evaluation.
- **Duration and digit-grouped literals.** `every 2s`, `after 500ms`,
  `pulse.add: wave, 1, 400ns`: `s` multiplies into milliseconds; `ms`, `us`,
  and `ns` pass through so a literal can name the unit its API documents.
  Underscores group digits in any base: `1_000_000`,
  `0b1000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000`. All of it is lexer-level sugar over the
  same int.

### Changed

- **Native names follow one charter** (see CONTRIBUTING.md): predicates end
  in `?`, counts are nouns, no abbreviations, one spelling per word.
  Renamed: `ms` → `wait` (the sleep gets a verb; `millis`/`micros` clock
  reads are unchanged), `pad.len` → `pad.length`, `tcp.bytes-ready?` →
  `tcp.available`, `adc.above` → `adc.above?`, and the test-only
  `frothy.fire-event` → `frothy.event-fire`. The old spellings are gone —
  no aliases.
- **A call's arguments end where the next call begins — for every operator.**
  Previously only `+` stopped before a following call, so
  `fib: n - 1 - fib: n - 2` silently parsed as `fib: (n - 1 - fib: n - 2)`
  and recursed forever. Now `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, comparisons, `and`, and `or`
  all follow the same sentence. Parentheses opt an inner call back into an
  argument: `gpio.write: pin, (1 - gpio.read: pin)`. `see` re-renders old
  code with the needed parens.
- **Chained comparison is a parse error.** `1 < 2 < 3` no longer evaluates
  `true < 3`; the error suggests joining two comparisons with `and`.
- **`not` negates a whole comparison.** `not x = 1` now means `not (x = 1)`,
  matching Python, Ruby, Lua, and SQL. Inside arithmetic, `not` needs
  parentheses.
- **`is` inside a block declares a local: `x is 5`.** Position decides scope:
  at the top level `is` binds a slot as before; in a body it declares a local
  in the innermost block. `here x is 5` still parses and means exactly the
  same thing. `set` never declares — setting an undeclared name now says
  "declare it first with is" alongside the near-miss suggestion.
- **Cell rows are asked for with a colon call: `readings is cells: 3`.** The
  old `cells(3)` spelling was the only parenthesized call shape in the
  language; parentheses now always mean grouping. The old form fails with a
  pointer to the new spelling.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6 is an official board.** Firmware builds for the
  C6's RISC-V target, uses its native USB Serial/JTAG console and documented
  board pins, and ships in the web-flasher release bundle.

### Fixed

- **ESP-IDF portability follows each chip's hardware.** Application UARTs now
  count only high-power controllers, GPIO wake uses the wake mechanism offered
  by the selected target, and CPU clocks stay in chip-specific configuration.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Firmware projects can remove offered capabilities.** A `[capabilities]`
  table in `frothy.toml` now accepts `ble = false` and carries that choice
  through the generated profile header and ESP-IDF configuration.

### Fixed

- **Library requirements are checked against the composed firmware.** A build
  rejects a library whose required capability was disabled, while requirements
  on known always-on capabilities remain valid.
- **Homebrew release instructions use the archive's version directly.** The
  formula template no longer expects a redundant version substitution.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Runtime errors now show the rejected value.** Type, range, native-argument,
  handle, and busy-resource failures retain their compact numeric code while
  also reporting the value that caused the failure and, where useful, the
  expected kind or native argument position.

### Changed

- **Unsaved volatile state is a notice, not a failed programming session.** A
  `save` blocked by a live handle or buffer identifies the affected slot,
  terminates with `ok`, and leaves the device ready for the next form. The CLI,
  browser serial client, and VS Code extension preserve that distinction.
- **Browser editor and serial-client packages now live in Frothy App.** Core
  retains the language, firmware, CLI, VS Code extension, and human serial
  contract without owning browser project state or browser package builds.

### Fixed

- **CLI source framing can no longer mistake code for device status.** Reserved
  text such as `ok`, multiline forms, and status-looking source are sent in a
  source envelope; real device errors make `frothy send` exit nonzero and stop
  later file forms, including in records mode.
- **Interrupts settle once without losing the next form.** Host- and
  device-originated interrupts now complete the active response and preserve
  plain and records-mode file sequencing.
- **Firmware manifests include a checksum for every flash segment.** Consumers
  can validate each downloaded bootloader, partition-table, and application
  image before flashing.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **A bounded, inspectable Bluetooth Low Energy system.** Frothy can scan,
  advertise, hold one central or peripheral connection, install a small GATT
  server, and use one foreground GATT client procedure with short values,
  notifications, and indications.

### Changed

- **BLE state and limits stay visible through ordinary Frothy words.** Scan,
  connection, queue, procedure, error, and memory state remain inspectable,
  while `ble.off`, `clear`, and full recovery invalidate handles and release
  the radio.
- **The VS Code release artifact advanced to 0.5.1.** Its device vocabulary is
  fetched only when requested instead of appearing after every run.

### Fixed

- **Full recovery still erases saved state when BLE cleanup reports an error.**
  Restart then releases any remaining platform-owned state.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **A physical safe-boot path and a movable live console.** For 600 ms after a
  normal reset, Ctrl-C or a tap of the active-low BOOT button skips the saved
  user project and its `boot` word without erasing either one. `console.uart:`,
  `console.default:`, and `console.info:` can move, restore, and inspect the
  live REPL while that safe window always begins on the board default console.

- **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 is an official board.** Board manifests now own
  the chip, pins, LED polarity, and default console for both XIAO and ESP32
  DevKit V1. CI and release bundles build and identify both boards.

- **Bounded edge capture and timed pulse output.** The new `trace.*` words can
  record digital transitions and the new `pulse.*` words can build and play a
  timed waveform. The shipped examples use them to inspect I2C traffic and
  drive a WS2812 frame.

- **Newlines can separate expressions inside blocks.** Multiline `[...]`
  forms no longer need a semicolon at the end of each line; semicolons remain
  available when several expressions share one line. The CLI, browser editor,
  and VS Code now preserve those newlines when they send a form, and multiline
  errors point to the physical line that failed.

- **The editors now follow complete language forms and live device state.**
  The browser editor 0.2.1 and VS Code extension 0.4.0 run multiline forms,
  browse the connected device's words, surface device diagnostics, and keep
  connection and run state visible.

### Changed

- **The packaged CLI can flash official release firmware.** Board discovery,
  reset, wipe, and flash use the same manifests as the firmware build, while
  source-build commands consistently find the Frothy checkout root.

- **Web-flasher releases are board-complete segmented bundles.** Each release
  carries the ESP-IDF bootloader, partition table, and application segments at
  their generated flash addresses instead of one board-specific merged image.

### Fixed

- **Interrupting a running program returns the editor to idle immediately.**
  The friendly `ok — interrupted` line did not end with the wire protocol's
  required bare `ok`, so browser and CLI requests remained pending until a
  second Ctrl-C. Interrupts now report `interrupted`, terminate with `ok`, and
  return the normal prompt in one response.

- **ESP32 board behavior now follows board data.** ADC GPIO mapping, active-low
  LEDs, USB Serial/JTAG versus UART console selection, and schedulable
  millisecond waits no longer assume the DevKit V1 wiring everywhere.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Interrupting a running program is no longer reported as an error.**
  Stopping a loop with Ctrl-C or the boot button showed
  `error: interrupted (10)`; it now prints a calm `ok — interrupted`. The
  change is device-side, so the web editor and VS Code stop flagging a
  deliberate stop as a failure too.

- **A `save` that can't persist a value now says which slot and why.**
  Instead of a bare `unsupported (9)`, the error names the slot and the
  reason — for example `cannot save slot 'x' - bound to a word this firmware
  does not provide`.

### Fixed

- **No more `esp_mmu_map` error log on save (ESP32).** With a saved image
  already mounted, every `save` printed a benign but alarming
  `E (…) esp_mmu_map: paddr block is mapped already`. Save re-mapped the slot
  it had already mapped; it now reuses the existing mapping.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- **`save` no longer corrupts when a word matches a built-in.** Saving a word
  whose bytecode is byte-identical to a built-in — for example `x is led.on`, or
  a blink word that calls `led.on` — aborted with `corrupt data (11)`. The code
  encoder's deduplication scanned base-image codes that the bind resolver skips,
  so such a word was deduped away and then could not be resolved. The two scans
  now agree, and the word gets its own record.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-09

The first tagged release. Frothy is a live language for small 32-bit
microcontrollers: flash a board, open a prompt, define words, inspect what the
device knows, and save your work back onto it.

### Language

- **Error handling** — `attempt [ ... ] rescue [ ... ]`, with `error.code` and
  `error.name` inside the rescue block. `INTERRUPTED` is never catchable.
- **Friendly diagnostics** — compile and runtime errors report a phrase and
  code; compile errors also show the offending source with a caret and a
  did-you-mean suggestion.
- **Loops and locals** — `repeat N as <name>` exposes the loop index; `here`
  declares a mutable local.
- **Records** on the device profile, plus `gpio.output` / `gpio.input` /
  `adc.percent` convenience words.

### Libraries

- **Dependencies** — a project's `frothy.toml` can depend on a Frothy library by
  git URL (with rev or branch) or by path; `frothy fetch` / `frothy build`
  resolve, fetch, and compile them. Pure-Frothy and native (C) libraries are
  both supported.

### Editors

- **Browser editor** (frothy.dev) — an examples picker, run control (interrupt,
  stop-on-first-error), autosave, grouped error diagnostics, and a
  vertical/horizontal split for the device output.
- **VS Code extension** — connect, send, inspect, and save/restore over a live
  session; `Frothy: Open Example`; correct `--` comment support.

### Project

- **Continuous integration** — host suites, an ESP32 firmware build, an
  end-to-end library fixture, and the examples battery run on every change.
- **Examples** — one-screen sketches that teach the language and double as the
  host smoke battery.
- **Release automation** — a version tag builds and attaches the web-flasher
  firmware and the VS Code extension to a GitHub release.
