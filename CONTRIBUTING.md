# Contributing to Frothy

Frothy is small on purpose. Good contributions keep the system easier to read,
build, and explain.

## Getting Set Up

Clone the repo and build the local CLI:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nikokozak/frothy
cd frothy
make cli
```

Then use the CLI to install and check the host tools:

```sh
frothy bootstrap
frothy doctor
```

`frothy bootstrap` installs ESP-IDF under your user account; do not use `sudo`.
See `README.md` for the full walkthrough.

## Running The Checks

Run the suites that cover the surface you changed:

```sh
make test
make test-unity
make test-host-normal-transcript
make test-esp32-plain-host-transcript
make test-lib-e2e
go test ./cmd/... ./internal/...
(cd editors/vscode && npm test)
```

CI runs all of these on every pull request, plus both official ESP-IDF board
builds.

## What A Good PR Looks Like

Keep it small and focused. Tests should ride with the change.

Match the surrounding style. Prefer one plain purpose per function, clear data
shape before behavior, and names a stranger can read without project history.

If a change touches hardware behavior, say which board you used and how you
verified it.

## Naming The Native Vocabulary

Every public word a sketch can call follows the same small charter. Check a
new native against it before adding the row:

- **One metaphor per module.** All of a module's words tell one story:
  `open`/`close` bracket a resource, `read`/`write` move values,
  `start`/`stop` toggle an activity, `dump` prints a human-readable view.
  Do not mix registers (`open` in one word, `begin` in its sibling).
- **Predicates end in `?` and return a boolean.** `wifi.ready?`,
  `adc.above?`. A word that returns a count is a noun, never a `?` word:
  `uart.available`, `tcp.available`.
- **No abbreviations a stranger must decode.** `pad.length`, not `pad.len`.
  Established hardware vocabulary (`gpio`, `adc`, `pwm`, `i2c`, `ms`) is not
  an abbreviation; it is the domain's name for the thing.
- **Module first, then noun, then verb.** `ble.scan.start`,
  `frothy.event-register`. The dotted name is one word to the parser, so the
  order is pure readability: sort by what, then which, then does.
- **Constructors that take a variant keep the base name plus a suffix.**
  `uart.open` picks default pins; `uart.open-on` takes them explicitly.
- **A word has exactly one spelling.** Renames land without aliases once the
  architect approves them; `.alias` exists only for deliberate second names
  like `pin` for `gpio.write`.

## Releasing And Firmware Bundles

The website and Frothy App consume the web flasher's firmware files from this
repo. Firmware files carry embedded build timestamps and are never
byte-identical between builds, so "update it" always means "rebuild and
re-vendor", never "diff the bytes". Browser editor and serial-client source
belong to Frothy App; its package builds produce the standalone bundles still
vendored by frothy.dev.

**Version scheme.** `vX.Y.Z` git tags are the project release. The VS Code
extension keeps its own `package.json` version.

**Update the flasher firmware** on a site checkout (needs ESP-IDF via
`frothy bootstrap` and the pinned Arduino-Pico core):

```sh
tools/build-flasher-bundle.sh ~/Developer/frothy-site/static/test/flash/firmware
```

This discovers every official firmware board, runs its normal build, packages
either ESP-IDF's generated flash segments or the target's declared UF2, and
writes one flasher `manifest.json` with the build version from `git describe`.

This command writes firmware only. Refresh frothy.dev's serial-client bundle
from Frothy App as documented beside the site's flasher assets.

**Cut a release.** Update `CHANGELOG.md`, then tag and push:

```sh
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the same
flasher bundle and `make vsix`, then attaches the manifest, firmware files, and
`.vsix` to a GitHub release. Re-vendor the site bundles from the tagged commit
so the live site matches the release.

**Publish the CLI through Homebrew** only after that tag archive is reachable.
Render the proven formula template with the real release values:

```sh
version=X.Y.Z
url="https://github.com/nikokozak/frothy/archive/refs/tags/v${version}.tar.gz"
firmware_url="https://github.com/nikokozak/frothy/releases/download/v${version}/frothy-firmware-v${version}.tar.gz"
curl -fL "$url" -o "/tmp/frothy-${version}.tar.gz"
curl -fL "$firmware_url" -o "/tmp/frothy-firmware-${version}.tar.gz"
sha256="$(shasum -a 256 "/tmp/frothy-${version}.tar.gz" | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"
firmware_sha256="$(shasum -a 256 "/tmp/frothy-firmware-${version}.tar.gz" | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"
sed -e "s|@URL@|${url}|g" \
    -e "s|@SHA256@|${sha256}|g" \
    -e "s|@FIRMWARE_URL@|${firmware_url}|g" \
    -e "s|@FIRMWARE_SHA256@|${firmware_sha256}|g" \
    packaging/homebrew/frothy.rb.in > /tmp/frothy.rb
brew style /tmp/frothy.rb
```

Review `/tmp/frothy.rb`, then commit it as `Formula/frothy.rb` in the dedicated
tap. The package installs `frothy`, `esptool`, `picotool`, and the release
firmware, so `frothy flash BOARD` works without a source checkout. Firmware
development and custom firmware builds still require the Frothy source and the
selected board toolchain. Publishing the tap is a separate authorized release
action, never part of an ordinary code push.
